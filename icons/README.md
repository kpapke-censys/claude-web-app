# Ship Rekt PWA Icons

This directory contains pirate-themed icons for the Ship Rekt Progressive Web App in various sizes.

Since I cannot create actual PNG files without additional tools, here are the required icon sizes:

- 72x72 pixels
- 96x96 pixels  
- 128x128 pixels
- 144x144 pixels
- 152x152 pixels
- 192x192 pixels
- 384x384 pixels
- 512x512 pixels

## How to create the pirate icons:

1. Create a base icon (512x512 recommended) with pirate ship or treasure theme
2. Use an online tool like https://realfavicongenerator.net/ or a tool like ImageMagick to resize to all required sizes
3. Name them as: icon-{size}x{size}.png (e.g., icon-192x192.png)
4. Replace this README.md with the actual PNG files

## Suggested pirate icon design:
- Background: Ocean blue gradient from #1e40af to #1e3a8a
- Icon: Pirate ship silhouette, treasure chest, or skull and crossbones in gold/white
- Zelda Wind Waker inspired aesthetic - cartoon style, bright colors
- Make sure it looks good at small sizes (72x72)
- Use rounded corners for modern look
- Ensure it meets PWA maskable icon requirements

## Temporary Placeholders:
For now, placeholder files with pirate emoji are created for each required size.
